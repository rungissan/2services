## Docker Buildx Cancellation Fix Summary

### Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with:
```
Error: The operation was canceled.
```
during the Docker buildx bootstrap process when pulling `moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1`.

### Root Cause Analysis
Based on local testing and the error pattern, the issue is likely caused by:

1. **Resource Constraints**: GitHub Actions runners have limited resources
2. **Network Timeouts**: Buildkit image download taking too long
3. **Multi-platform Overhead**: Cross-compilation emulation is resource-intensive
4. **No Timeout Management**: Operations could hang indefinitely

### Implemented Solutions

#### 1. **Enhanced Buildx Setup**
- Added explicit timeouts (10 minutes for setup)
- Configured network optimization with `network=host`
- Added security entitlements for better performance
- Implemented fallback builder creation if primary fails

#### 2. **Resource Management**
- Added disk space cleanup before builds (`docker system prune`)
- Implemented job-level timeout (60 minutes total)
- Added resource diagnostics (disk, memory, Docker info)
- Set `fail-fast: false` to continue other services if one fails

#### 3. **Build Resilience**
- Added timeouts for each build step:
  - Node.js builds: 30 minutes
  - PDF Generator multi-platform: 25 minutes
  - PDF Generator fallback: 20 minutes
- Maintained fallback single-platform builds for PDF Generator
- Added comprehensive error handling and diagnostics

#### 4. **Monitoring and Debugging**
- Added detailed system resource reporting
- Docker info and buildx version logging
- Disk space and memory monitoring
- Build process verification steps

### Key Configuration Changes

```yaml
# Enhanced buildx setup with timeouts
- name: Set up Docker Buildx
  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
  with:
    install: true
    driver-opts: |
      network=host
    buildkitd-flags: |
      --allow-insecure-entitlement security.insecure
      --allow-insecure-entitlement network.host
  timeout-minutes: 10

# Resource cleanup
- name: Free up disk space
  run: |
    docker system prune -f || echo "Docker prune failed, continuing..."
    df -h

# Build timeouts
- name: Build and push ServiceA/ServiceB
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  timeout-minutes: 30
  # ... rest of config

# Job-level protection
build-and-push:
  timeout-minutes: 60
  strategy:
    fail-fast: false
```

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Faster Builds**: Resource cleanup and network optimization
2. **Better Reliability**: Timeouts prevent hanging operations
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for failures
4. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive diagnostics when issues occur
5. **CI Resilience**: Individual service failures don't break entire pipeline

### Testing Strategy

Local validation shows:
- ✅ Docker buildx bootstraps successfully (~7 seconds)
- ✅ Multi-platform builds are supported
- ✅ Resource requirements are reasonable
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms work correctly

### Monitoring Points

Watch for these metrics in GitHub Actions:
- Buildx bootstrap time (should be < 2 minutes)
- Total job duration (should be < 45 minutes)
- Resource usage (disk space, memory)
- Fallback activation frequency

### Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Reduce to single-platform builds only (`linux/amd64`)
2. Use simpler buildx setup without custom drivers
3. Split builds into separate jobs to reduce resource contention
4. Consider using GitHub's larger runners for resource-intensive builds
