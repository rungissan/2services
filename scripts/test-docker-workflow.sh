echo "   - Docker buildx is functional"
echo "   - Multi-platform builds are supported"

echo "💡 If GitHub Actions fails, it might be due to:"
echo "   - Resource constraints in the runner"
echo "   - Network timeouts during buildkit bootstrap"
echo "   - Multi-platform emulation overhead"
echo ""
echo "🔧 Mitigation strategies implemented:"
echo "   - Added timeouts to prevent hanging"
echo "   - Added fallback single-platform build"
echo "   - Added resource diagnostics"
echo "   - Added fail-fast: false to continue other services"
